Complete structure and content plan for the NooLife marketing website built with Astro.

## HERO SECTION

**Headline:** "This Winter Arc Decides Everything. 10 Weeks to Your New Life."

**Subheadline:** "66 days to separate yourself from everyone settling for average. This winter arc decides if you're a winner or just another resolution that dies in February."

**CTA:** App Store + Google Play buttons

**Visual:** 5 iPhone mockups side-by-side showing home → stats → assets → rating → journey

**Micro-copy under CTA:** "Download now. Your move."

## PROBLEM AGITATION

*2-column layout*

### Left Column - "Stop Lying to Yourself"
You know exactly what you should be doing. The gym membership you bought in January? Still unused. The books piling up on your nightstand? Unread. That "tomorrow I'll start" promise you keep making? We both know how that ends.

You're not lacking information. You're lacking execution. And every day you put it off, the gap between who you are and who you could be gets wider.

### Right Column - "The Uncomfortable Truth"
Your future self is watching you right now. And they're disappointed.

Not because you're not capable—but because you keep choosing the easy path. Scrolling instead of sweating. Snoozing instead of showing up. Talking about change instead of becoming it.

Winter arc isn't just a trend. It's the line between people who actually do it and people who just talk about it. Which side are you on?

---

## THE WINTER ARC HOOK

**Headline:** "66 Days. March 1st. New You."

**Copy:**
Count the days. 66 days from now, winter ends and spring begins. While everyone else is making excuses about the cold and the dark, you're building an unfair advantage.

They'll scroll through another season. You'll walk into March as someone completely different. Better habits. Higher rating. Actual results.

This is your winter arc. The gap between you and everyone settling for mediocrity starts here. NooLife makes sure you finish what you start.

**Visual:** Simple timeline graphic showing Nov/Dec/Jan/Feb → March 1st (New You)

---

## HOW IT WORKS

*3 steps*

### 1. Face the Truth
Rate yourself honestly across 8 core habits. See the gap between who you are (2.3/10) and who you could be (9.2/10). That uncomfortable feeling? That's the wake-up call you need.

### 2. Your 66-Day Program Begins
No generic advice. Your personalized program stacks habits based on behavioral science. Intensity increases gradually. You get stronger, the system gets harder. That's how winners are built.

### 3. Track Your Climb
Every completed task raises your rating. Every day you show up, you separate yourself from average. Watch your 2.3 turn into an 8.7. GTA-style progression, rank badges, visual proof you're leveling up.

---

## FEATURES GRID

*Icon + Title + 1-liner each*

- **Offline-First**: No internet? No problem. No excuses accepted. The app works anywhere, always.

- **Momentum Over Perfection**: We track your trajectory, not just streaks. Miss a day? Get back up. We measure who you're becoming, not one bad day.

- **GTA-Style Progression**: Rank badges, asset unlocks, visual rewards. Discipline pays off. Watch your in-app status rise as you level up in real life.

- **8 Core Habits**: Workout, Meditation, Reading, Screen Time, Cold Showers, Running, Water, Wake-Up Time. The fundamentals that separate high performers from everyone else.

- **Your Potential Rating**: Live score showing the gap between current you and your ceiling. Every task completed closes that gap. Make it shrink daily.

- **66-Day Psychology**: Research-proven timeframe for identity-level change. Not quick fixes. Real transformation that sticks.

## SCIENCE-BACKED CREDIBILITY

*Replaces testimonials section*

**Headline:** "Built on Research, Not Motivational Bullshit"

### 3 stat blocks:

**66 Days to Automaticity**
Phillippa Lally's UCL study proves it: 66 days is the average timeframe for habit formation. Not 21 days. Not "whenever you feel like it." 66 days of showing up builds automatic behavior. That's the program length. That's the commitment.

**Identity-Based Change**
We don't just track what you do. We change who you are. Based on James Clear's Atomic Habits framework—your actions shape your identity. Complete the program, become the person who doesn't need the program.

**Habit Stacking That Works**
BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits research integrated into every program. Stack new behaviors on existing ones. Start small, build momentum, scale up. Science-backed progression, not random challenges.

**Footer micro-copy:** "Methodology backed by peer-reviewed research in behavioral psychology. Not invented by some guru on Instagram."

## VISUAL COMPARISON

*Before/After but for identity - Split screen layout*

### LEFT: "You Right Now" (muted, grey, losing)
**Rating: 2.3/10**
- 4 hours scrolling daily
- Gym? 5 skipped days out of 7
- Books read this year: 0
- Promises made to yourself: Broken
- Your potential: Wasting away

**This is comfortable. This is also pathetic.**

### RIGHT: "You March 1st" (vibrant Jade Green, winning)
**Rating: 8.7/10**
- 90min daily deep work sessions
- 58-day workout streak (and counting)
- 6 books completed, knowledge applied
- Promises made: Kept
- Your potential: Unlocked

**This is uncomfortable. This is also powerful.**

**CTA:** "Choose Your Side"

## FAQ SECTION

*Collapsible accordion, 5-6 questions*

### Is this another streak-tracking app?
No. Streak apps make you feel like shit when you miss a day. NooLife tracks your identity transformation. We gamify discipline so it's actually rewarding to show up. Miss a day? Your progress doesn't vanish—but you will see exactly how it affects your rating. Accountability without the guilt trip.

### What if I miss a day?
You get back up. That's it. We track momentum, not perfection. One missed day doesn't erase 20 good ones. But here's the deal: your rating will reflect it. Your streak might break. The app doesn't coddle you, but it also doesn't reset you to zero like you're starting over. Real life happens. Winners adapt and keep moving.

### Can I customize my habits?
Yes. We recommend 8 core habits based on research, but you control intensity levels, timing, and can add from our library of 16 total options. That said—if you skip the hard ones (cold showers, early wake-ups), you're only cheating yourself. Your rating knows the difference.

### Is it free?
Free to download. Core features work without payment. Premium unlocks advanced tracking, all visual rewards, and detailed analytics. No credit card required to start. No tricks. Download it, use it, decide if you want more.

### Do I need internet to use it?
No. Built offline-first. Works on planes, in basements, in the middle of nowhere. Internet is only for cloud backup and device sync. Zero excuses accepted.

### What happens after 66 days?
You're a different person. The habits are automatic. Your identity has changed. You can keep tracking, start a new 66-day arc with different habits, or just maintain what you've built. Most people? They start another arc. Because once you see what 66 days of discipline does, you don't want to go back to average.

## FINAL CTA SECTION

**Headline:** "Your Future Self Is Watching. Make Them Proud."

**Subheadline:** "Every day you wait, the gap gets wider. Every day you scroll past this page without downloading, you're choosing average. March 1st is coming whether you're ready or not. The only question: will you be different, or will you be the same?"

**CTA:** App Store + Google Play (large buttons)

**Urgency text above buttons:** "66 days. That's all it takes. Or keep making excuses—your call."

**Trust elements below CTA:**
- Works offline. No excuses.
- Free to start. No credit card.
