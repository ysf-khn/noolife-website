NooLife is a self improvement / habit tracker app.
It takes the user's current habits - wake up time, water intake, workout, running, meditation, reading time, cold showers, social media. These are the 8 core habits of the app.
We also allow users to select 2 out of 8 additional optional habits to track - no fap, no alcohol, no smoke, praying, sit ups, pushups, journaling, studying.

User enters their current time for these things - current wake up time, current water intake per week, workout hours per week, distance run per week, meditation duration per week, reading time per week, cold showers per week, social media time daily.
Similarly they enter the details for the additional optional habits if they select one.

After getting these details, the app generates a 66 day improvement plan which gives users around ~450 tasks spread out the whole 66 day duration, so there's tasks for the user to do everyday to improve their lives and become the main character in their lives.

It also gives the user a rating out of 100 to show where they currently stand acc to our algorithms.
The rating has - overall, discipline, strength, wisdom, focus and confidence.
Overall rating is calculated based on the other 5.

So after the plan is generated user can see their current ratings and potential rating that they could reach if they follow the 66 day plan.

The app also tracks task completion streak. User has to complete at least 2 tasks per day to initiate and keep the streak.

The app has 5 major screens - home, stats, journey, assets, my noolife rating.

The home screen shows: the streak count, overall rating, shows the current day of the plan, a motivational message that changes everyday, all the tasks organized in tabs (todos, completed, skipped/failed).
The task cards have a nice gta inspired background with a character performing the concerned task.

The Stats screen: shows the time elapsed since user started the plan, and also a heatmap for every habit, along with stats graphs of every habit showing the visual improvement in their ratings. The heatmap also helps users see the days they showed up.

The journey screen shows 4 cards for every day where user can keep like a daily jorunal which involves - today's mood, completed tasks, visual journal (photo/video of the day) and text journal (how today felt like, the challenges, wins, etc). This is from day 1 to day 66 so user can see their whole journey of change.

The assets screen has mini apps like guided meditation seesion of varying lengths, pomodoro focus timers, and workout tracker. The workout tracker isnt linked with the workout task though. It's totally different. All these mini apps have bg images inspired by gta visuals again.

Then the my noolife rating screen shows the user's rating in three tabs - current rating, potential rating, day 1 rating. The background image is again a beautiful gta inspired character shot.

All of the visuals of the app are beautiful, cinematic and gta inpired.
So as to bring up that feeling of being the main character in your own life.

Since the task cards involve a character, the character's gender is same as what the user chooses in the app, so both males and females can relate max.
