            You know exactly what you should be doing. The gym membership you
            bought in January? Still unused. The books piling up on your
            nightstand? Unread. That "tomorrow I'll start" promise you keep
            making? We both know how that ends.
          </p>

            You're not lacking information. You're lacking execution. And every
            day you put it off, the gap between who you are and who you could be
            gets wider.

            Not because you're not capable, but because you keep choosing the
            easy path. Scrolling instead of sweating. Snoozing instead of
            showing up. Talking about change instead of becoming it.
