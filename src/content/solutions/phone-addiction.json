  "problem": "Can't Stop Scrolling Your Phone",
  "problemSlug": "phone-addiction",
  "commonSymptoms": [
    "Reaching for phone within 30 seconds of waking up",
    "Checking phone during conversations, meals, work",
    "Phantom vibration syndrome (feeling phone buzz when it didn't)",
    "Scrolling social media 'for 5 minutes' that becomes 2 hours",
    "Anxiety when phone isn't nearby (separation anxiety)",
    "Screen time reports showing 5-8+ hours daily despite 'barely using it'"
  ],
  "rootCauses": [
    "Variable reward schedule = slot machine dopamine hits (strongest addiction mechanism)",
    "Infinite scroll design exploits brain's novelty-seeking circuits",
    "Social validation through likes/comments rewires reward system",
    "Phone replaces boredom tolerance (brain never learned to sit with discomfort)",
    "Fear of missing out (FOMO) creates compulsive checking behavior",
    "No competing dopamine sources (exercise, hobbies, reading abandoned)"
  ],
  "scientificExplanation": "Phone addiction rewires dopamine pathways like substance addiction. Research from Dr. Anna Lembke (Stanford) shows smartphone use triggers same brain regions as cocaine. Variable reward (never know what you'll see next) creates strongest behavioral conditioning. Average person touches phone 2,617 times/day. Each scroll = micro dopamine hit. Over time, baseline dopamine drops, requiring more stimulation for same reward. You're not weak—you're neurologically hijacked by billion-dollar design teams.",
  "failedSolutions": [
    "Willpower alone ('I'll just use my phone less')",
    "App blockers you disable after 20 minutes",
    "Deleting apps then reinstalling them the next day",
    "Going cold turkey (phone required for work, navigation, communication)",
    "Screen time limits you bypass with 'ignore limit' button"
  ],
  "whyTheyFail": "Willpower depletes. Blockers can be disabled. Cold turkey isn't realistic (you need phone for legitimate reasons). These approaches fight addiction directly without addressing root cause: dopamine deficiency and lack of competing rewards. You don't need less phone—you need better dopamine sources and gradual reduction.",
  "actualSolution": "Progressive phone reduction over 66 days paired with dopamine-rebuilding habits (workout, meditation, reading). NooLife tracks social media usage as one of 10 habits. Replace phone scrolling time with competing behaviors that rebuild baseline dopamine: exercise (endorphins), reading (sustained attention), meditation (impulse control). Reduce daily phone time 15 min/week. By Day 66: 2-3 hours less screen time, dopamine sensitivity recovered, boredom tolerance rebuilt.",
  "nooLifeApproach": "NooLife tracks phone/social media reduction alongside 7 dopamine-rebuilding habits (workout, meditation, cold shower, reading, waking early). App doesn't shame you—it measures progress. Focus Rating climbs as screen time drops. Each completed non-phone task = dopamine from real achievement (not fake Instagram dopamine). GTA-style task visuals make discipline feel rewarding. You're not 'quitting phone'—you're becoming someone with better dopamine sources.",
  "expectedTimeline": "Week 1-2: High phone urges. Boredom feels unbearable. BUT: Alternative habits starting (workout = endorphins, meditation = impulse control). Week 3-4: Phone urges declining. Able to sit without phone for 20+ min. Focus Rating improving. Week 5-6: Phone usage 30-40% reduced. Dopamine baseline recovering. Social media feels less appealing. Week 8-10: Screen time 2-3 hours less daily. Phone is tool, not crutch. Boredom tolerance rebuilt.",

    {
      "question": "How do I reduce phone time when I need my phone for work?",
      "answer": "You're not eliminating phone—you're reducing compulsive usage. Target social media, games, news scrolling (non-essential apps). Keep work apps, communication, navigation. NooLife tracks 'social media control' habit specifically. Reduce non-essential usage 15 min/week over 66 days. You keep phone functionality, lose addiction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can't I just delete social media apps?",
      "answer": "Cold turkey often fails (you'll reinstall during weak moment). Progressive reduction works better: use apps less over time while building competing dopamine sources (workout, reading). By Day 66, social media loses appeal naturally because your brain has better dopamine sources. You're not 'resisting'—you genuinely prefer real life."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I've tried app blockers and they didn't work?",
      "answer": "Blockers fail because you can disable them (willpower required). NooLife doesn't block—it replaces. Every workout, meditation, reading session = dopamine from real achievement. Your brain chooses better option naturally. No willpower, no blocking, just better alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before phone addiction improves?",
      "answer": "Week 1-2: Awareness building, urges high. Week 3-4: Screen time reducing 30-40 min/day, alternative habits forming. Week 6-8: Dopamine baseline recovering, phone urges significantly weaker. Week 10+: Screen time 2-3 hours less daily, boredom tolerance rebuilt. Compare your Day 1 vs Day 66 screen time data—proof it worked."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I lose all my social connections if I reduce phone use?",
      "answer": "No. You're reducing mindless scrolling, not meaningful communication. You'll still text friends, check messages, stay connected. What changes: 2 hours of Instagram scrolling becomes 30 min of intentional social media use. Quality connections improve because you're present during conversations (not checking phone). Real relationships strengthen."
