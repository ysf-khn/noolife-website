  "commonSymptoms": [
    "Start strong Monday, quit by Thursday (never make it past Week 1)",
    "Downloaded 10+ habit tracker apps, used each for 3-5 days max",
    "New Year's resolutions abandoned by January 10th every year",
    "Know exactly what you need to do but can't maintain consistency",
    "Envy people who 'just do things' but you can't figure out how",
    "Shame cycle: Quit habit → feel bad → avoid trying again for months"
  ],
  "rootCauses": [
    "Trying to change 5+ habits simultaneously (willpower overload)",
    "Going too hard too fast (2-hour workouts when baseline is zero)",
    "All-or-nothing mindset: one miss = total failure in your mind",
    "No accountability system (brain knows there's no real consequence)",
    "Habit trackers that reset to zero (demotivating after first slip)",
    "Misunderstanding habit formation science (21 days myth = false, actual: 66 days)"
  ],
  "scientificExplanation": "Habit formation takes 66 days on average for automaticity (Lally et al. 2009, UCL)—not 21 days. Most people quit within 7-14 days because they: 1) Overload willpower trying to change everything at once, 2) Set unrealistic intensity (crash fast), 3) Use all-or-nothing thinking (one miss = perceived total failure). Your prefrontal cortex (impulse control) requires progressive training. Trying to do 10 habits perfectly = willpower depletion = quit everything. Starting with 2-3 habits at sustainable intensity + forgiving progress system = actual behavior change.",
  "failedSolutions": [
    "Massive New Year's life overhauls (10 habits starting Jan 1)",
    "Habit trackers with empty checkboxes and no structure/guidance",
    "Streak apps that reset to zero after one miss (shame-based design)",
    "Motivation videos and inspirational content (temporary emotion, not system)",
    "Trying to copy elite performers' routines (their baseline ≠ yours)"
  ],
  "whyTheyFail": "Changing 10 habits at once depletes willpower faster than it builds. Empty checkbox trackers provide no guidance on HOW to build habits. Zero-reset systems trigger shame spirals. Motivation fades by Day 5 (emotion, not structure). Elite routines assume fitness/discipline baseline you don't have yet. These approaches ignore habit science: Start small, progressive difficulty, forgiving system, 66-day minimum commitment.",
  "actualSolution": "NooLife's 66-day progressive system: Start with 2-3 core habits (meditation, workout, wake time). Complete minimum 2 tasks/day (low barrier = high compliance). Progressive difficulty as habits form. App doesn't reset to zero—maintains progress with 2-task minimum. After 66 days: Habits feel automatic (willpower no longer required). Then add 2-3 more. Build habit-forming skill progressively, not all at once.",
  "nooLifeApproach": "NooLife tracks up to 10 habits BUT starts you at YOUR baseline (not fantasy goals). Personalized 66-day plan with 450 progressive tasks. Requires 2 tasks/day to maintain streak (forgiving, not punishing). Discipline Rating shows cumulative skill-building (32/100 → 78/100). After Week 1 data, app adjusts difficulty. You're not 'trying to stick to habits'—you're becoming 'person who follows through.' Identity shift = permanent change.",
  "expectedTimeline": "Week 1-2: Habits feel effortful, willpower required. BUT: 2-task minimum is manageable. Streak building. Week 3-4: Tasks becoming routine. Trust building ('I say, I do'). Week 5-6: Habits forming. Identity shift starting ('I follow through'). Week 8-10: Automaticity reached. Habits feel like brushing teeth. Can add 2-3 more habits. Habit-forming skill acquired.",

    {
      "question": "Why do I quit every habit after 3-5 days?",
      "answer": "You're trying to change too much at once (willpower overload) or going too hard too fast (unsustainable intensity). Starting 10 habits Jan 1 or doing 2-hour workouts when baseline is zero = crash by Day 5. NooLife starts with 2-3 habits at YOUR baseline. Progressive difficulty over 66 days = sustainable. You don't quit because the system is designed for your actual capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why 66 days and not 21 days like I've heard?",
      "answer": "The 21-day myth comes from misinterpreted plastic surgery research (not habit formation). Actual research (Lally et al. 2009, UCL) shows 66 days average for habit automaticity (range: 18-254 days depending on complexity). Most people quit at 7-14 days thinking they 'failed' when they're only 20% through. 66 days gets you past automation threshold."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I miss a day? Do I have to start over?",
      "answer": "No. NooLife doesn't reset to zero. If you maintain 2 tasks/day minimum, your streak continues. One miss doesn't erase 30 days of neural pathway building. Your Discipline Rating shows cumulative progress. Elite performers bounce back same-day. Progress over perfection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose which habits to start with?",
      "answer": "NooLife recommends: meditation (mental foundation), workout (physical foundation), wake time (discipline anchor). These 3 build self-control that transfers to all other habits. Master these first (66 days), then add 2-3 more. Trying 10 habits at once = none stick. Sequential mastery works."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before habits feel automatic?",
      "answer": "Week 1-2: Effortful, willpower required. Week 3-4: Slightly easier, routine forming. Week 6-8: 70% automatic, willpower decreasing. Week 10+: Full automaticity—habits feel like brushing teeth. Your Discipline Rating trajectory shows exact progress. Day 66 habits require zero willpower (that's automation)."
