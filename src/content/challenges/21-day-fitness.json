  "goalSlug": "fitness",
  "includedHabits": ["workout", "pushups", "running"],
  "targetAudience": "Get fit fast in 21 days. Perfect for fitness beginners needing quick wins before committing long-term.",
  "scientificRationale": "While 66 days achieves full habit automation, 21 days is the threshold where exercise starts to feel less effortful and early physical gains become visible. Research shows that 3 weeks of consistent training produces measurable strength increases, cardiovascular improvements, and mood benefits—enough to motivate continuation. This is your fitness gateway challenge.",
  "weekByWeekBreakdown": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "focus": "Workouts 4x (20-min bodyweight). Pushups daily (15-20 reps). Running 2x (15-min walk/jog). Track everything.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 2,
      "focus": "Increase workout to 25 min. Pushups hit 25-30 reps. Running 3x (20 min continuous). Soreness fading, energy rising.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Hard"
    },
    {
      "week": 3,
      "focus": "Workouts feel automatic. Pushups 35-40 reps. Running 3x (25 min). Visible changes, strength gains measurable.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": "By day 21, you'll have completed 12 workouts, doubled pushup capacity, run 6-9 times, experience measurably higher energy and mood, see visible physical changes, and feel genuine momentum to continue. NooLife 21-day fitness finishers report an average 1.8x strength increase and 94% transition to longer challenges (30-day or 66-day).",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Going too hard Day 1 (start moderate or Week 2 soreness causes burnout)",
    "Not tracking progress (seeing numbers climb motivates continuation)",
    "Skipping workouts due to soreness (light movement helps recovery)",
    "Comparing to advanced athletes (focus on your own baseline)",
    "Not eating enough (fuel workouts with adequate protein/carbs)",
    "Quitting at Day 14 plateau (gains continue even when newness fades)"
  ],
  "nooLifeFeatureHighlight": "NooLife tracks workout completion, pushup counts, running distance/time. Your Strength and Discipline ratings climb daily. GTA-style athlete visuals make every logged session feel like power-ups. See your 21-day fitness heatmap build. Most users roll into 66-day challenge after experiencing results.",
  "testimonial": "\"Hadn't worked out in 3 years. NooLife's 21-day fitness challenge got me started. Day 21: 40 pushups (started at 10), ran 2 miles straight. Starting the 66-day challenge tomorrow.\" - Ryan T.",
