  "challengeName": "30-Day Reading Challenge",
  "challengeSlug": "30-day-reading-challenge",
  "duration": 30,
  "goal": "Reading Habit",
  "goalSlug": "reading",
  "includedHabits": ["reading", "social-media-control"],
  "targetAudience": "Read 3-5 books in 30 days. Perfect for those who 'want to read more' but spend hours scrolling instead.",
  "scientificRationale": "The average person reads less than 1 book per year, yet spends 2.5 hours daily on social media. By swapping 30 minutes of scrolling for reading for 30 days, you'll complete 3-5 books and experience measurable cognitive benefits: improved vocabulary, focus, empathy, and reduced stress. Research shows that just 6 minutes of reading reduces stress by 68%. This is simple habit substitution with massive ROI.",
  "weekByWeekBreakdown": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "focus": "15 pages daily (20-30 min). Replace evening scrolling with reading. Social media limit: 1 hour. Track daily completion.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 2,
      "focus": "20 pages daily. Social media down to 45 min. Notice improved focus and sleep (reading before bed vs scrolling).",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 3,
      "focus": "25 pages daily. First book completed (~200-250 pages). Sense of accomplishment. Pick next book immediately.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 4,
      "focus": "30 pages daily. Social media optional, not compulsive. 2nd book done. Reading is now favorite part of day.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": "By day 30, you'll have read 3-5 books (600-900 pages), read 20-30 pages daily automatically, reduced social media use by 50-75%, experience measurably improved focus and vocabulary, sleep better, and genuinely identify as 'a reader.' NooLife 30-day reading finishers report an average of 4.2 books completed and 68% reduction in social media time.",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Starting with dense, boring books (pick what genuinely interests you)",
    "Not tracking pages (seeing progress motivates continuation)",
    "Replacing reading time with other distractions (protect your reading window)",
    "Quitting when book is boring (switch books—just keep reading)",
    "Not limiting social media (you can't add reading time without removing scrolling time)",
    "Reading only non-fiction (fiction reduces stress differently and builds empathy)"
  ],
  "nooLifeFeatureHighlight": "NooLife tracks daily reading completion and page count. Log books finished. Your Wisdom and Focus ratings climb daily. GTA-style library visuals make every reading session feel like intelligence building. Pair with social media limits to reclaim time. See your 30-day reading heatmap and book count prove transformation.",
  "testimonial": "\"Read zero books in 2023, scrolled 3+ hours daily. NooLife's 30-day reading challenge changed everything. Day 30: 5 books finished, social media down to 20 min/day. I'm smarter, calmer, more interesting. Reading is my new scroll.\" - Maya L.",
