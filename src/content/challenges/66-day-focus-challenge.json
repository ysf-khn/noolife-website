  "includedHabits": [
    "meditation",

  ],
  "targetAudience": "Train your attention span to superhuman levels. Perfect for those with ADHD tendencies, constant distractions, or scattered focus.",
  "scientificRationale": "Attention is trainable. Research shows that meditation increases gray matter in attention-related brain regions, while social media decreases it. By combining daily meditation (attention training), social media limits (dopamine detox), deep reading (sustained focus practice), and studying (deliberate concentration) for 66 days, you rebuild attention span from scattered to laser-focused. This is neuroscience-backed focus training.",
  "weekByWeekBreakdown": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "focus": "Meditation 5 min daily (breath focus). Social media limit: 1 hour. Reading 10 pages. Notice how often mind wanders.",

    },
    {
      "week": 2,
      "focus": "Meditation 10 min. Social media down to 45 min. Reading 15 pages. Studying/deep work 20 min. Focus slightly improving.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Hard"
    },
    {
      "week": 3,
      "focus": "Meditation 15 min. Social media 30 min max. Reading 20 pages. Notice ability to sustain focus improving.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 4,
      "focus": "Meditation 20 min feels effortless. Mind wanders less. Reading comprehension measurably better. Attention span growing.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 5,
      "focus": "Add deep work sessions (60-90 min). Use phone in another room. Notice how rare distractions become.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 6,
      "focus": "Social media optional, not compulsive. Reading 30+ pages feels easy. Deep work sessions hit 2 hours. Focus is superpower.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 7,
      "focus": "Meditation 20-30 min. Mind is calm, focused. Notice how people comment on your presence and listening.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 8,
      "focus": "Focus is now core identity. Distractions feel uncomfortable. You enter flow states easily.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"

    {
      "week": 9,
      "focus": "Maintain discipline even during chaos. Your focus is your competitive advantage in distracted world.",

      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": "By day 66, you'll meditate 20-30 min daily with minimal mind-wandering, limit social media to <30 min, read 20-30 pages with full comprehension, sustain deep work for 90-120 min, and operate with laser focus. NooLife focus finishers report an average 84% improvement in sustained attention and 72% reduction in distractibility.",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Not removing phone during focus sessions (phone proximity reduces cognitive capacity even when off)",
    "Multitasking instead of monotasking (focus means one thing at a time)",
    "Skipping meditation on 'busy' days (5 min matters more than 0 min)",
    "Replacing Instagram with TikTok (all dopamine-loop platforms damage focus)",
    "Not tracking progress (seeing focus improvements in data motivates continuation)",
    "Giving up during ADHD-like scatter periods (these pass—consistency wins)"
  ],
