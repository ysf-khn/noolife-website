  "challengeName": "30-Day Hydration Challenge",
  "challengeSlug": "30-day-hydration-challenge",
  "duration": 30,
  "goal": "Daily Hydration",
  "goalSlug": "hydration",
  "includedHabits": ["water-intake", "workout"],
  "targetAudience": "Drink 64-100oz water daily for 30 days. Perfect for chronic under-drinkers and those with low energy/focus.",
  "scientificRationale": "75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. Even mild dehydration (2% body weight) impairs cognitive function, mood, and physical performance. Research shows that adequate hydration improves energy, focus, skin quality, and digestion. By drinking 64-100oz daily for 30 days, you normalize hydration levels and experience compounding benefits. This is the simplest high-impact habit.",
  "weekByWeekBreakdown": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "focus": "64oz daily (eight 8oz glasses). Track intake. Notice increased bathroom trips (this normalizes). Energy slightly improving.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 2,
      "focus": "Increase to 80oz. Pair with workouts (hydration improves performance). Skin looks clearer. Headaches reducing.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 3,
      "focus": "Hit 100oz on workout days, 80oz on rest days. Energy and focus measurably better. Hunger cues clearer.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 4,
      "focus": "Hydration automatic. Keep water bottle everywhere. Notice physical/mental performance improvements. Track benefits.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": "By day 30, you'll drink 80-100oz daily automatically, experience measurably higher energy and focus, clearer skin, reduced headaches, improved digestion, and better workout performance. NooLife hydration finishers report an average 42% improvement in daily energy and 67% improvement in skin quality.",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Not tracking intake (you drink less than you think without measurement)",
    "Drinking all water at once (spread throughout day for absorption)",
    "Giving up due to frequent bathroom trips (this normalizes after Week 1-2)",
    "Replacing water with coffee/soda (these don't count toward hydration goal)",
    "Not carrying water bottle (proximity matters—keep it visible)",
    "Forgetting to drink until evening (front-load hydration in morning/afternoon)"
  ],
  "nooLifeFeatureHighlight": "NooLife tracks daily water intake in ounces. Set goal (64-100oz), log throughout day. Your Strength rating improves (hydration supports physical performance). GTA-style refreshing visuals make every logged glass feel like a health power-up. See your 30-day hydration heatmap prove consistency.",
  "testimonial": "\"Drank maybe 20oz daily, always tired, constant headaches. NooLife's 30-day hydration challenge changed everything. Day 30: 90oz daily, energy through the roof, skin glowing. Simplest game-changer ever.\" - Lisa K.",
  "ctaAngle": "Track daily water intake and feel the difference. Free 3-day trial.",
