  "includedHabits": ["running", "workout", "water-intake"],
  "targetAudience": "Go from couch to 5K in 66 days. Perfect for non-runners ready to build endurance and cardiovascular health.",
  "scientificRationale": "Running is the most accessible cardio: no equipment, no gym, just you and the road. Research shows that progressive running programs over 8-10 weeks (56-70 days) safely build aerobic capacity from zero to 5K (3.1 miles). By running consistently for 66 days using walk/run intervals that gradually increase, you build cardiovascular fitness, mental toughness, and running habit automation. This is proven Couch-to-5K methodology.",
  "weekByWeekBreakdown": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "focus": "Walk/run intervals 3x: 1 min run, 2 min walk, repeat 6x (15-20 min total). Track every session.",

    },
    {
      "week": 4,
      "focus": "Continuous 15-min runs 3x. Add 4th shorter run. Cardiovascular fitness measurably improving.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 5,
      "focus": "20-min continuous runs. Running feels automatic. Recovery faster. Endurance building rapidly.",

    {
      "week": 6,
      "focus": "25-min runs 3x. First 5K attempt (may need walk breaks—that's okay). Running is now identity.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 7,
      "focus": "Continuous 30-min runs. 5K without walking. Notice mental clarity, stress relief from running.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 8,
      "focus": "Running 4-5x weekly. 5K in under 35 min. Experiment with pace, distance goals. You're a runner now.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 9,
      "focus": "Run in all weather (rain, cold, heat). True runners run regardless. Discipline peaks.",

    {
      "week": 10,
      "focus": "Day 66: 5K in under 30 min. Compare Day 1 (couldn't run 1 min) vs now. Running is permanent habit.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": "By day 66, you'll run 5K (3.1 miles) continuously, complete 40-50+ runs, experience measurably improved cardiovascular health, reduced stress, better sleep, and genuinely identify as a runner. NooLife running finishers report an average 5K time of 28-32 min and 96% continue running beyond 66 days.",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Starting too fast (stick to walk/run intervals or you'll get injured)",
    "Skipping rest days (recovery is when fitness builds—run 3-4x weekly max initially)",
    "Wrong shoes (invest in proper running shoes to prevent shin splints)",
    "Not tracking progress (seeing times improve motivates continuation)",
    "Comparing to experienced runners (focus on your own baseline)",
    "Weather excuses (rain/cold/heat—run anyway, that's what makes you a runner)"

  "nooLifeFeatureHighlight": "NooLife tracks running frequency, distance, time. Log every run with duration and distance. Your Strength and Discipline ratings climb daily. GTA-style athlete runner visuals make every logged run feel like endurance building. See your 66-day running heatmap and distance progression—proof you're a runner.",

  "challengeFAQs": [
    {
      "question": "I've never run before. Can I really go from couch to 5K in 66 days?",
      "answer": "Yes. NooLife's plan uses proven Couch-to-5K methodology: gradual walk/run intervals that build aerobic capacity safely. Week 1 is mostly walking with short run bursts. By Week 6-8, you're running continuously. Thousands have done this. The key is following the progressive plan and not skipping ahead."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I can't complete a run?",
      "answer": "Walk. Seriously. If you're supposed to run 10 min but can only do 5, walk the rest. Log it as completed. Showing up matters more than perfection. Your body is adapting. Tomorrow's run will be slightly easier. NooLife tracks your progression—every run builds fitness even if it felt hard."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I avoid injury?",
      "answer": "1) Invest in proper running shoes (visit running store for fitting). 2) Don't skip rest days (run 3-4x weekly max initially). 3) Follow the plan (don't jump ahead to longer runs). 4) Listen to pain (sharp pain = stop, muscle soreness = normal). 5) Stretch and hydrate. Most injuries come from doing too much too soon."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a realistic 5K time for a beginner?",
      "answer": "NooLife finishers average 28-32 min by Day 66. Elite: sub-25 min. Beginner: 30-40 min. Walking: 45-60 min. Your goal isn't to win races—it's to run 5K continuously without stopping. Speed comes with more training. Finishing > time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I run every day?",
      "answer": "No. Running is high-impact—your body needs recovery. Start with 3x/week (Mon/Wed/Fri). Increase to 4x after Week 4-6. Elite runners do 5-6x, but that's after months/years of base building. Rest days prevent injury and allow fitness adaptations. NooLife's plan builds in proper recovery."
