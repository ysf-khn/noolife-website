  "challengeName": "21-Day Meditation Challenge",
  "challengeSlug": "21-day-meditation",
  "duration": 21,
  "goal": "Meditation Foundation",
  "goalSlug": "meditation",
  "includedHabits": ["meditation"],
  "targetAudience": "Learn to meditate in 21 days. Perfect for skeptics and those who think 'meditation isn't for me.'",
  "scientificRationale": "Meditation seems esoteric until you experience it. Research shows that just 2-3 weeks of daily meditation produces measurable reductions in stress, improvements in focus, and better emotional regulation. By committing to 10 minutes daily for 21 days, you overcome the initial discomfort, experience real benefits, and build the foundation for lifelong practice. This is your meditation gateway.",
  "weekByWeekBreakdown": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "focus": "5-10 min daily, guided meditation (breath focus). Mind wanders constantly—this is normal. Just show up daily.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 2,
      "focus": "10 min daily. Restlessness peaks. Notice brief moments of calm. This is where most people quit—don't.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Hard"
    },
    {
      "week": 3,
      "focus": "10-15 min daily. Meditation feels less torturous. Notice improved stress management, better sleep. You're a believer now.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": "By day 21, you'll meditate 10-15 minutes daily with less resistance, experience measurably lower stress and anxiety, improved emotional regulation, better focus, and genuine momentum to continue. NooLife 21-day meditation finishers report an average 48% reduction in perceived stress and 89% transition to 30-day or 66-day challenges.",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Judging yourself for 'bad' sessions (every session counts—consistency is the win)",
    "Expecting instant enlightenment (benefits are subtle, cumulative, and real)",
    "Trying to stop thoughts (meditation is observing thoughts, not eliminating them)",
    "Not using guided meditations (structure helps beginners enormously)",
    "Skipping when stressed ('no time to meditate' = when you need it most)",
    "Quitting during Week 2 discomfort (push through—Week 3 is breakthrough)"
  ],
  "nooLifeFeatureHighlight": "NooLife tracks daily meditation completion and duration. Built-in guided meditation sessions in Assets screen (5, 10, 15 min options). Your Focus, Wisdom, and Confidence ratings improve daily. GTA-style peaceful visuals make every session feel like mental leveling up. See your 21-day meditation streak build.",
  "testimonial": "\"Thought meditation was woo-woo nonsense. NooLife's 21-day challenge proved me wrong. Day 21: 15 min daily, anxiety down 50%, sleep better. I'm continuing indefinitely.\" - Tom R.",
