  "targetAudience": "The most intense challenge. 90 days to become unrecognizable. Perfect for those ready to commit to total life transformation—no half measures.",
  "scientificRationale": "While 66 days achieves habit automaticity, 90 days creates identity-level change. Research from behavioral psychology shows that 12 weeks (90 days) is the threshold where temporary behavior change solidifies into permanent identity shift. By stacking 10+ habits across physical, mental, emotional, and intellectual domains for 90 straight days, you're not just building habits—you're becoming a fundamentally different person. This is the challenge that separates those who talk from those who transform.",

NooLife 90-day finishers report an average 92% improvement across all 5 rating dimensions. You'll have completed 270+ workouts/tasks, meditated 90 straight days, and built an unshakeable identity as someone who does impossible things.",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Trying to go 100% intensity Day 1 (you'll burn out by Week 3—build incrementally)",
    "Not planning for disruptions (travel, illness—have backup plans)",
    "Comparing yourself to others (this is you vs. you 90 days ago)",
    "Skipping rest days (recovery is part of the plan—don't overtrain)",
    "Quitting during 'Week 5-6 flatline' when dopamine normalizes and novelty fades (this is where champions are made)",
    "Not tracking progress (NooLife data shows how far you've come when motivation dips)",
    "Breaking streak during holidays or weekends (90-day warriors don't take days off)"
  ],

  "testimonial": "\"Day 1: 220 lbs, depressed, scrolling 5 hours daily. Day 90: 185 lbs, read 18 books, learned SQL, ran a 10K, haven't watched porn in 90 days. NooLife tracked every single day. I'm literally a different human.\" - Carlos M.",
