  "challengeName": "66-Day Alcohol-Free Challenge",
  "challengeSlug": "66-day-no-alcohol",
  "duration": 66,
  "goal": "Alcohol-Free Living",
  "goalSlug": "no-alcohol",
  "includedHabits": [
    "no-alcohol",
    "workout",
    "meditation",
    "reading",
    "journaling"
  ],
  "targetAudience": "Experience life without alcohol for 66 days. Perfect for those curious about sober living or ready to quit for good.",
  "scientificRationale": "Alcohol disrupts sleep architecture, impairs cognitive function, and creates dependence cycles. Research shows that 66 days alcohol-free produces measurable improvements: REM sleep increases 40-60%, liver enzymes normalize, mental clarity improves, and psychological dependence breaks. By replacing drinking rituals with healthy habits (workout, meditation, reading), you rewire reward pathways. This isn't just abstinence—it's neurological reset.",
  "weekByWeekBreakdown": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "focus": "Complete abstinence begins. Track sleep quality improvements. Notice cravings during usual drinking times. Log them.",

    {
      "week": 2,
      "focus": "First weekend sober. Replace Friday drinks with workout or reading. Notice improved Saturday morning energy.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Hard"
    },
    {
      "week": 3,
      "focus": "Sleep quality measurably better. Add meditation (10 min) for stress management. Skin/eyes look clearer.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 4,
      "focus": "First social event sober. Navigate without alcohol. Notice you don't need it to have fun. Identity shift begins.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 5,
      "focus": "Energy levels at all-time high. Mental clarity improved. Add journaling to process emotions without numbing.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "week": 6,
      "focus": "Alcohol-free feels normal. Notice weight loss, better skin, improved mood stability. Track measurable benefits.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 7,
      "focus": "Social situations feel comfortable sober. You say 'I don't drink' confidently, not 'I'm trying not to.'",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 8,
      "focus": "Physical transformation visible. Mental fog gone. Sleep is restorative. Reflect on before/after differences.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "week": 9,
      "focus": "Navigate holidays/celebrations sober. Prove you don't need alcohol to celebrate or relax. Rituals replaced.",

    },
    {
      "week": 10,
      "focus": "Day 66: Alcohol-free identity cemented. Decide if you'll continue (most do). Life is better without it.",
      "expectedDifficulty": "Easy"
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": "By day 66, you'll have saved 60+ drinking occasions, experience measurably better sleep quality (REM increase), mental clarity, energy levels, and physical appearance (weight loss, skin quality). NooLife alcohol-free finishers report an average 68% improvement in sleep quality, 54% improvement in energy, and 82% continue abstinence beyond 66 days.",
  "commonPitfalls": [
    "Not replacing drinking rituals (Friday beer → Friday workout/movie)",
    "Keeping alcohol in the house ('for guests'—get rid of it)",
    "Justifying 'just one drink' (one always becomes more)",
    "Not tracking progress (seeing benefits in NooLife data prevents relapse)",
    "Isolating from social events (you can still go out—just don't drink)",
    "Underestimating withdrawal symptoms in Week 1-2 (sleep may worsen briefly before improving)"
