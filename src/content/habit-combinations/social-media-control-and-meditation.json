    "explanation": "Quitting social media without replacement = boredom + relapse. Meditation provides the replacement. Both target same system: Dopamine regulation. Social media = artificial dopamine hits (infinite scroll). Meditation = natural dopamine baseline restoration. Research shows mindfulness reduces phone checking compulsion by 35%. You're not just removing bad habit (scrolling). You're building better habit (presence).",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I have to delete social media completely or just limit it?",
      "answer": "Complete deletion works better. 'Limiting' to 30 min/day = constant willpower battle. Deletion = decision made once. Keep messengers if needed for work/family, but delete scroll apps (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter). All-or-nothing approach has higher success rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does meditation actually help with phone addiction?",
      "answer": "Meditation trains impulse control (prefrontal cortex strengthening) and urge observation (notice craving without reacting). When urge to check phone arises → you notice it → breathe → urge fades. That awareness gap breaks the automatic checking loop."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I need social media for work/business?",
      "answer": "Use desktop only, no phone apps. Schedule specific times (9am, 3pm) for desktop social media management. Phone apps = doom scrolling. Desktop = intentional use. This boundary prevents addiction while allowing professional use."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until FOMO goes away?",
      "answer": "Peak FOMO: Days 3-14. Manageable: Week 3-4. Gone: Week 6-8. Most users report FOMO fully resolved by Day 45. Paradox: Life gets MORE interesting without social media (you're actually living, not watching others live)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I relapse and reinstall the apps?",
      "answer": "Delete immediately, restart. Most people relapse 2-3 times before it sticks. Each relapse teaches you triggers. Use meditation after relapse (process guilt/shame without spiraling). Progress isn't linear - persistence matters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I just use meditation without quitting social media?",
      "answer": "Meditation helps but won't override addiction. It's like meditating while smoking - meditation reduces harm but doesn't eliminate problem. Best results: Quit social media + meditation fills void. Attack from both sides."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time will I reclaim?",
      "answer": "Average social media use: 2-4 hours/day. That's 730-1460 hours/year (equivalent to 18-36 full work weeks). Imagine what you could do with 36 extra weeks. Read 50 books, learn language, build business. Time reclamation is massive."
