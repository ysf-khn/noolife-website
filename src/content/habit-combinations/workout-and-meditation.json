    "explanation": "Most people train mindlessly - going through motions, scrolling between sets, zero mind-muscle connection. Pre-workout meditation primes proprioception (body awareness), improving form by 25%. Post-workout meditation reduces cortisol (stress hormone that kills gains) by 30%. This isn't woo - it's performance optimization. You're training mind AND body simultaneously.",

    {
      "question": "Should I meditate before or after working out?",
      "answer": "Both have benefits. Pre-workout meditation improves focus and form. Post-workout meditation enhances recovery and reduces cortisol. Start with post-workout (easier when tired). Add pre-workout after Week 4 once habit is established."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't meditation make me too relaxed to lift heavy?",
      "answer": "No. Pre-workout meditation is about focus, not relaxation. You're setting intention, visualizing success, clearing mental clutter. This enhances performance, it doesn't sedate you. Think: calm focus, not sleepy calm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I meditate before/after workouts?",
      "answer": "Start small: 3-5 minutes. Work up to 5 min pre-workout, 10-15 min post-workout. Quality beats duration. A focused 5 minutes beats a distracted 20 minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I meditate at the gym or should I do it at home?",
      "answer": "Home is better (less distraction). Meditate before leaving for gym (pre-workout) or after showering at home (post-workout). Gym meditation is awkward unless you have a private space."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of meditation works best with workouts?",
      "answer": "Pre-workout: Visualization + breath focus (prepare mind). Post-workout: Body scan + gratitude (recovery). Avoid deep relaxation meditations pre-workout - you want alertness, not sleepiness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this actually improve my gains?",
      "answer": "Yes. Mind-muscle connection improves form = better muscle activation. Lower cortisol = less muscle breakdown. Better recovery = more frequent training. Indirect but significant impact on gains."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I hate sitting still after an intense workout?",
      "answer": "Use walking meditation or gentle stretching meditation. You don't need to sit cross-legged. Lie down, walk slowly, or stretch while focusing on breath. Adapt meditation to your state."
