  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Will working out really reduce urges?",
      "answer": "Yes. Research shows intense exercise reduces sexual urges by 70% for 4-6 hours. The physical exhaustion + dopamine release temporarily overrides libido. When urge hits → gym → urge passes. It's biochemical urge management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of workout works best for NoFap?",
      "answer": "High-intensity: Heavy lifting (squats, deadlifts), HIIT cardio, boxing, wrestling. You need physical exhaustion + achievement feeling. Low-intensity (walking, yoga) won't provide same urge relief. Go hard."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will NoFap actually help me build muscle faster?",
      "answer": "Testosterone peaks Day 7 of NoFap (146% increase), then stabilizes. This temporary boost may help gains, but main benefit is energy/motivation. You'll train harder during NoFap (more aggression, drive). That intensity = better gains."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm in flatline and have no energy to workout?",
      "answer": "Flatline (Days 20-40): Low libido, low energy. Light workouts okay (don't skip entirely). Focus on showing up, not performance. By Week 6, energy returns stronger than ever. Flatline is temporary - push through."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I workout every time I have an urge?",
      "answer": "Ideally yes (urge = gym trigger). But also do daily scheduled workouts (preventive). Morning workouts reduce all-day urge frequency. Emergency gym trips handle breakthrough urges. Both strategies together = maximum effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do this without a gym membership?",
      "answer": "Yes. Home workouts work if intense enough. Pushups to failure, burpees, sprints, bodyweight circuits. But gym is better (leaving house breaks urge pattern, seeing others exercising motivates). If home: High intensity essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until gym feels like a craving instead of chore?",
      "answer": "2-3 weeks: Gym = urge relief (you appreciate it). Week 6-8: Gym = passion (you love gains). Day 66: Gym is identity. Many NoFappers become gym addicts (healthy addiction). The energy transmutation becomes automatic."
