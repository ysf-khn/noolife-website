    {
      "question": "Should I meditate before or after studying?",
      "answer": "BEFORE is critical. Pre-study meditation clears mental clutter and primes focus. Post-study meditation is bonus (helps memory consolidation) but optional. Always meditate before - that's where the focus benefit comes from."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I meditate before studying?",
      "answer": "Start with 5 minutes. Work up to 10 minutes. Longer isn't necessarily better - 10 focused minutes beats 30 distracted minutes. The key is clearing your mind before diving into material."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I fall asleep during meditation?",
      "answer": "Don't meditate lying down before studying. Sit upright in chair. If still sleepy, do 10 jumping jacks before meditating (wake up body), then meditate, then study. Meditation should energize, not sedate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this actually improve my grades?",
      "answer": "Yes, if you're struggling with focus/attention. If you already have laser focus, meditation adds less. But most students mind-wander 47% of study time. Reducing that to 12% = massive grade improvement. Not magic, but science."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of meditation works best for studying?",
      "answer": "Focus-based meditation: Breath counting, mantra repetition, or body scan. Avoid deep relaxation (you'll get sleepy). Goal is alertness + calmness, not sleepiness. Insight Timer app has 'focus meditation' category - use those."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I meditate once in morning for all study sessions?",
      "answer": "Better to meditate before each study block. Morning meditation helps, but pre-study meditation creates immediate focus boost. If doing 3 study sessions, ideally meditate before each. Quality over quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I notice focus improvements?",
      "answer": "Some notice immediately (Day 1). Most notice by Day 7-10. Research shows significant improvements by Day 14. Be patient - it's skill building. By Day 30, meditation-enhanced focus feels automatic."
