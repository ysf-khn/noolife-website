    "headline": "Why Sobriety + Gym Creates Faster Physical Transformation Than Either Alone",
    "explanation": "Alcohol sabotages fitness 3 ways: (1) Disrupts protein synthesis (muscle building), (2) Increases cortisol (fat storage), (3) Kills testosterone (strength gains). Quit alcohol = hormonal reset. Add gym = capitalize on that reset. Research shows sober exercisers gain muscle 47% faster than those who drink. Plus: Gym provides replacement dopamine. You're not just removing alcohol (void) - you're building physique (purpose).",

    "Thinking 'just one drink' won't affect gains (one drink = 48-hour protein synthesis impairment)",
    "Replacing alcohol with other substances (weed, pills - just shifts addiction)",
    "Training fasted during early sobriety (blood sugar unstable during detox - eat before gym)"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to workout while detoxing from alcohol?",
      "answer": "Light exercise (walking, yoga, light weights) is safe and helpful. Heavy training should wait until Day 7-14 (body needs to stabilize first). Heavy drinkers: consult doctor before starting any exercise program. Listen to your body - if dizzy/nauseous, rest."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will quitting alcohol really make that much difference in my fitness?",
      "answer": "Massive difference. Alcohol blocks protein synthesis (muscle building) by 37%, increases cortisol (fat storage), kills testosterone, disrupts sleep (recovery), adds empty calories. Removing alcohol = removing the #1 saboteur of fitness progress."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I relapse and drink - do I lose all my gains?",
      "answer": "One night drinking = 48 hours impaired protein synthesis. Weekly drinking = perpetually impaired gains. Monthly drinking = minimal impact. The dose makes the poison. Relapse doesn't erase all progress, but consistency matters. Get back on track immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I drink protein shakes or is that cheating on sobriety?",
      "answer": "Protein shakes are food, not alcohol. Drink them. Common confusion: non-alcoholic beer counts as sober (0.5% alcohol negligible). Focus: zero ethanol consumption. Protein, caffeine, supplements = all fine."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle social pressure to drink?",
      "answer": "Tell them you're in training (nobody questions athletes). Hold non-alcoholic drink (people stop asking). Change social venues (climbing gym > bar). New identity: 'I'm focused on fitness.' After Day 60, confidence to decline without explanation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I lose weight or gain weight after quitting alcohol?",
      "answer": "Depends on gym approach + diet. Quit alcohol + no diet change = lose fat (removing empty calories). Quit + gym + high protein = lose fat + gain muscle (body recomposition). Quit + gym + surplus calories = muscle gain. Track both weight and body composition."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see physical transformation?",
      "answer": "Week 2-3: Face less puffy, better sleep, more energy. Week 4-6: Fat loss visible, some muscle definition. Week 8-10: Dramatic transformation obvious to others. Before/after photos at Day 66 will shock you. Patience required but results inevitable."
