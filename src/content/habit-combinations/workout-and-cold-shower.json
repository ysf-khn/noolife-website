    "explanation": "Exercise creates micro-tears in muscle fiber (inflammation). Cold water immersion constricts blood vessels, reducing inflammation and flushing metabolic waste. When you warm up, fresh blood floods muscles with nutrients. This contrast therapy accelerates recovery by 40% compared to passive rest. You're not just working out harder - you're recovering smarter.",

    "Using lukewarm water (needs to be <15°C / 59°F to get recovery benefits)",
    "Expecting no soreness ever (cold reduces soreness, doesn't eliminate it - some is normal)",
    "Doing cold immediately after strength training for hypertrophy (wait 4+ hours if pure muscle growth is goal - debate ongoing)"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Should I take a cold shower before or after working out?",
      "answer": "Always AFTER. Cold showers before workouts reduce muscle activation and power output by 10-15%. Post-workout cold is for recovery - it reduces inflammation and speeds muscle repair. Pre-workout cold hurts performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I stay in cold water after a workout?",
      "answer": "5-10 minutes for most workouts. Up to 15 minutes after intense leg days or full-body sessions. Longer than 15 minutes may impair muscle growth adaptations (ongoing research). Quality over duration - 5 focused minutes beats 20 lukewarm minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will cold showers reduce my muscle gains?",
      "answer": "Controversial. Some studies suggest immediate post-workout cold (within 1 hour) may slightly reduce hypertrophy adaptations. Conservative approach: Wait 2-4 hours post-strength training if pure muscle growth is your goal. For most people, the recovery benefits outweigh any minor growth impairment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use ice baths or cold showers?",
      "answer": "Cold showers are 90% as effective and far more practical. Ice baths (10-15°C) are slightly better for recovery, but cold tap water (15-20°C) still works. Start with showers - upgrade to ice baths only if you're a serious athlete."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do cold showers on rest days?",
      "answer": "Yes. Cold showers on rest days reduce systemic inflammation and improve active recovery. You don't need a workout to benefit - cold therapy supports overall recovery and immune function."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why am I still sore even with cold showers?",
      "answer": "Cold reduces soreness by 20-30%, it doesn't eliminate it. Some soreness is normal (and necessary for adaptation). If soreness persists 72+ hours, you're either overtraining or not recovering enough (sleep, nutrition, stress management)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this work for cardio or just strength training?",
      "answer": "Both. Cold water immersion reduces inflammation from any intense exercise. Runners, cyclists, CrossFit athletes all benefit. Cardio = 5-10min cold. Strength = 10-15min cold. Adjust based on workout intensity."
