    "explanation": "Running alone increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) by 40% - this grows new brain cells. Meditation alone increases gray matter density by 5% in 8 weeks. Combined: Peak neurogenesis. Aerobic exercise + mindfulness create the optimal environment for brain growth. You're not just running for fitness. You're building a better brain with every mile.",

    {
      "question": "What is mindful running and how do I do it?",
      "answer": "Mindful running: Running with full presence, no distractions. Focus on breath rhythm (in-2-3, out-2-3), footstrike sound, body sensations. No music, podcasts, or mental planning. Just you, your body, and the movement. Start with 10-15 min mindful runs, work up to full runs. Feels awkward first few times - stick with it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I meditate before or after running?",
      "answer": "After is easier (you're tired, easier to sit still). Post-run meditation amplifies runner's high and speeds cortisol recovery. Pre-run meditation works if energizing (breathwork, visualization) - not deep relaxation. Most people prefer post-run. Advanced: Brief pre-run + longer post-run."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I listen to music during mindful running?",
      "answer": "Not during mindful runs - music is distraction. But mix it up: 2-3 mindful runs/week (no music), 2-3 music runs/week. Mindful running isn't about suffering - it's about presence. You'll crave the silent runs after Week 3."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I meditate after running?",
      "answer": "Start with 5 minutes. Work up to 10-15 minutes. Let heart rate settle first (2-3 min cool down walk). Then sit while still sweaty, ride the endorphin wave. Post-run meditation is the easiest meditation you'll ever do (body is naturally relaxed)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this make me a faster runner?",
      "answer": "Yes, indirectly. Mindful running improves form (20% better body awareness = more efficient stride). Post-run meditation speeds recovery (lower cortisol = less muscle breakdown). Better form + faster recovery = faster times. Bonus: Reduced injury rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can beginners do mindful running?",
      "answer": "Yes. Actually easier for beginners (you're not chasing pace). Focus on form, breath, presence. Walk-run intervals work great. Mindful running makes learning to run less painful - you're not fighting it, you're flowing with it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I hate running?",
      "answer": "Try mindful running before quitting. Most people hate running because they're mentally elsewhere (bored, distracted). Mindful running transforms it. You're present, not suffering. Many 'running haters' become running lovers after trying this. No guarantees, but worth testing."
