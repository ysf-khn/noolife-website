Together: Meditation quiets mental noise, revealing deeper patterns. Journaling captures those patterns before they evaporate. Research shows this combination reduces anxiety by 40% (vs. 15-20% for either alone). You're not just thinking about your life. You're understanding it.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Should I meditate before or after journaling?",
      "answer": "Always meditate BEFORE journaling. Meditation clears mental clutter and reveals deeper insights. Journaling captures those insights. If you journal first, you're writing surface thoughts. Meditation → Journal is the correct order for depth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I write about after meditating?",
      "answer": "Three prompts: (1) What did I notice during meditation? (emotions, thoughts, body sensations) (2) What patterns or themes emerged? (3) What insight wants to be explored? Don't force it - let the writing flow naturally from meditative state."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I wait between meditating and journaling?",
      "answer": "Immediately. Within 1-5 minutes max. Insights fade fast (70% lost within 30 minutes). Keep journal next to meditation cushion. Finish meditation → Open journal → Write. No gap, no distraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use a notes app instead of physical journal?",
      "answer": "Physical journal is better (handwriting deepens processing + no digital distractions). But digital is fine if you're consistent. Key: No scrolling social media between meditation and writing. Phone = temptation. Paper = focus."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if nothing interesting came up during meditation?",
      "answer": "Write that. 'Nothing interesting' is data. Maybe you're stressed, distracted, or need more sleep. Journaling about 'boring' meditations often reveals patterns: 'I've written 'distracted' 5 days straight - what's going on?' The mundane is meaningful."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to meditate every time I journal?",
      "answer": "No. You can journal independently (morning pages, gratitude, life events). But meditation-journaling is a specific practice for deep self-awareness. Reserve this ritual for when you want insight, not just recording events."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see benefits?",
      "answer": "Immediate: Post-meditation journaling feels easier (less blank page anxiety). Week 2-3: Anxiety reduction noticeable. Week 4-6: Pattern recognition kicks in. Day 66: You've built deep self-awareness. Reading old entries = 'wow, I've changed.'"
