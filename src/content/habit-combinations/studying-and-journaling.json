    "headline": "Why Writing About What You Learned Beats Re-Reading By 300%",
    "explanation": "Re-reading feels productive but creates 'fluency illusion' (familiar = mastered, false). Journaling forces active recall: retrieve info from memory without looking. Research shows active recall improves retention 300% vs. passive review. Post-study journaling also processes: What confused you? What connections exist? Metacognition (thinking about your thinking) is the highest level of learning.",

    "Skipping journaling when 'no time' (journaling SAVES time by improving retention)",
    "Perfect grammar focus (this isn't English class - messy thinking on paper beats no thinking)"

    {
      "question": "Should I journal before or after studying?",
      "answer": "AFTER is critical. Post-study journaling = active recall (retrieving info from memory strengthens it). Pre-study journaling optional (set intentions, clear mind) but post-study is where retention happens."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I write in my study journal?",
      "answer": "Four key questions: (1) What did I learn? (2) What confused me? (3) How does this connect to previous knowledge? (4) What questions remain? This format forces deep processing beyond surface memorization."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I journal while looking at my notes?",
      "answer": "No. Write from memory first (active recall). THEN check notes and add what you missed in different color. The struggle to remember = learning. Looking while writing = fluency illusion (feels productive but isn't)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I journal after studying?",
      "answer": "Start with 5 minutes. Work up to 10-15 minutes. If you studied 50 minutes, 10-minute journal is 20% time investment for 34% retention improvement. Best ROI in studying."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have nothing to write?",
      "answer": "That reveals: You didn't study effectively OR you need to review. If truly nothing stuck, re-study that material. Usually journaling reveals you learned more than you thought - writing surfaces hidden knowledge."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use pen and paper or digital?",
      "answer": "Pen and paper better (no digital distractions, tactile engagement aids memory). But digital works if using distraction-free app with internet OFF. Never journal on phone (notification temptation kills depth)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I use my journal for exam prep?",
      "answer": "Review journals instead of textbook. Your journal = personalized study guide in your words. Re-read for overview, then practice active recall on confusing sections. Many students find their journal questions match exam questions."
