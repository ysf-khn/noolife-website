    "explanation": "NoFap without meditation = white-knuckling through urges (40% relapse rate). NoFap WITH meditation = urge surfing - observing cravings without reacting (75% success rate). Meditation trains your prefrontal cortex (self-control center) while weakening limbic system reactivity (impulsive urges). You're not suppressing urges. You're changing your relationship with them. Urges arise → you notice → you breathe → they pass. No struggle, no relapse.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is urge surfing and how do I do it?",
      "answer": "Urge surfing: Observing cravings without reacting. When urge hits: (1) Stop what you're doing (2) Sit upright (3) Close eyes (4) Focus on breath (5) Notice where you feel the urge (body sensations, thoughts) (6) Watch it rise, peak, and fall like a wave (7) Don't resist, don't indulge, just observe. Urge passes in 10-15 min. Search 'urge surfing guided meditation' on YouTube for practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take for meditation to reduce urges?",
      "answer": "Immediate: Urge surfing interrupts acute cravings (works first time, improves with practice). Long-term: Daily meditation reduces baseline urge frequency by 40-50% around Day 30. By Day 66, urges are 70-80% less frequent and intense. It's cumulative."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to meditate every day or only when urges hit?",
      "answer": "Both. Daily morning meditation (10-20 min) builds baseline self-control (preventive). Emergency urge surfing handles acute cravings (reactive). Daily practice makes emergency surfing more effective. You're training the skill daily, applying it in crises."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I relapse even after meditating?",
      "answer": "Relapse doesn't mean meditation failed. Urge surfing is a skill - it improves with practice. First few times may not work perfectly. By session 10-15, success rate jumps to 70-80%. Also: Restart immediately, no shame spiral. Meditation helps you bounce back faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can meditation replace cold showers for NoFap?",
      "answer": "No, they serve different purposes. Cold showers = physical interrupt (instant relief, dopamine boost). Meditation = mental skill (long-term rewiring, urge management). Best results: Use both. Cold showers for emergency, meditation for daily baseline."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of meditation works best for NoFap?",
      "answer": "Mindfulness meditation (observing thoughts/sensations without judgment). Avoid visualization or tantric practices (can trigger urges). Focus on breath, body scan, or noting practice. Apps: Headspace, Insight Timer, or free YouTube guided sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal to have sexual thoughts during meditation?",
      "answer": "Yes, completely normal. The goal isn't to stop thoughts - it's to observe them without reacting. Thought arises → you notice → you return to breath. Each time you do this, you're weakening the urge-reaction pathway. This IS the practice working."
