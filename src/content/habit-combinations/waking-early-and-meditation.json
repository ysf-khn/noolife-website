    "explanation": "Morning meditation (vs. evening) sets your stress baseline for the entire day. Research shows morning meditation improves focus throughout the day by 28%, while evening meditation only impacts sleep. Early wake gives you a distraction-free window - no emails, no people, no chaos. This isn't just meditation. It's meditation when your brain is fresh, receptive, and undistracted. Peak neuroplasticity window.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is morning meditation better than evening?",
      "answer": "Morning meditation sets your stress baseline for the entire day - improving focus, mood, and resilience for 8-12 hours. Evening meditation only helps sleep. Morning also has zero distractions (no emails, people, chaos). Your mind is fresh, not fried from the day."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not a morning person?",
      "answer": "'Not a morning person' is learned behavior, not genetics. 21 days of consistent early wake + meditation rewires your circadian rhythm. By Day 30, you'll crave mornings. Your chronotype adapts when you give it consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How early do I actually need to wake up?",
      "answer": "Ideal: 5:30-6:30am. Key is waking BEFORE household chaos begins. If you have kids, wake 30-60 min before them. The goal is undisturbed quiet time, not a specific clock time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I drink coffee before meditating?",
      "answer": "No. Caffeine before meditation defeats the purpose. You want your natural, calm morning state - not jittery alertness. Meditate first (10-20 min), then coffee. The meditation will wake you up naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I fall asleep during morning meditation?",
      "answer": "Don't meditate in bed or lying down. Sit upright in a chair or on a cushion. If still sleepy, splash cold water on face first. After Week 2, sleep inertia fades - you'll stay alert naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I meditate before or after shower/breakfast?",
      "answer": "BEFORE everything. Alarm → Meditate → Shower → Breakfast. The moment you break the ritual (shower first, check phone, etc.), meditation gets delayed/skipped. First activity of the day, no exceptions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see benefits?",
      "answer": "Focus improvement: 7-10 days. Stress reduction: 14-21 days. Automatic habit: 40-60 days. Identity shift ('I'm a meditator'): 66 days. Most users feel transformed by Day 30, but push to Day 66 for permanence."
