    "explanation": "Evening workouts get skipped (work ran late, too tired, friends invited you out). Morning workouts happen at 6am before life interferes. Research shows morning exercisers have 40% higher adherence rates. But here's the key: Morning workout FORCES early wake. You can't hit snooze when the gym opens at 6am. This stack creates mutual accountability - workout needs early wake, early wake needs purpose (workout).",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Should I eat before a 6am workout?",
      "answer": "Light fuel: banana + water minimum. For intense lifting, add protein (Greek yogurt or shake). Full breakfast not needed - small pre-workout snack prevents energy crash. Save big meal for post-workout."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I not feel exhausted during morning workouts?",
      "answer": "First 2 weeks are brutal (sleep inertia). By Week 3, your body adapts. Tips: Drink water immediately upon waking, do 5 jumping jacks before leaving house (activates nervous system), start workout with dynamic warmup (not static stretching)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my gym doesn't open until 8am?",
      "answer": "Home workouts, outdoor running, or find 24-hour gym. The key is exercising within 60 min of waking. Waiting until 8am breaks the early-wake habit (you'll sleep until 7:30am). Exercise must force the early wake."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I workout at home instead of gym?",
      "answer": "Yes, but gym membership creates accountability (you paid for it, don't waste it). Home workouts easier to skip. If home: prepare equipment night before, follow structured program (no winging it), consider workout buddy accountability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I do cardio or strength training in the morning?",
      "answer": "Both work. Strength training: Testosterone peaks in morning (optimal for lifting). Cardio: Lower injury risk when muscles are warm (do 10-min warmup). Mix both throughout week. Consistency beats optimization."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will morning workouts make me too tired for work?",
      "answer": "Opposite. Morning exercise increases energy, focus, mood for 8-12 hours. You'll be more productive at work. The exhaustion myth comes from overtraining - keep intensity reasonable during adaptation phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until this becomes automatic?",
      "answer": "21 days: Ritual established. 40 days: Feels natural. 66 days: Fully automated. Most users wake before alarm by Day 45. By Day 66, skipping morning workout feels uncomfortable - your body craves it."
