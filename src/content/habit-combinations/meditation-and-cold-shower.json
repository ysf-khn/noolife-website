    "explanation": "Cold exposure activates your sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight), increasing alertness and norepinephrine. When you follow with meditation, you're training your parasympathetic system to calm this heightened state. This yin-yang effect builds stress resilience 3x faster than either practice alone.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Should I do cold shower before or after meditation?",
      "answer": "Cold shower first, then meditation. The cold exposure heightens your alertness and focus, making it easier to stay present during meditation. If you meditate first, you'll be too relaxed and likely skip the cold shower."
    },
    {
      "question": "How cold should the water be?",
      "answer": "As cold as your tap goes. You don't need ice baths. The key is the uncomfortable shock that triggers your nervous system adaptation. Start with 15 seconds at the end of a warm shower, gradually increasing duration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do this at night instead of morning?",
      "answer": "Not recommended. Cold exposure is highly stimulating and can disrupt sleep if done within 4 hours of bedtime. Morning cold showers align with your natural cortisol awakening response, amplifying alertness for the day ahead."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I can only stick to one habit?",
      "answer": "Start with meditation (easier entry point). Once that's consistent for 2 weeks, add the cold shower. NooLife's progressive plan does this automatically - it won't overwhelm you with both habits on Day 1."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this the Wim Hof Method?",
      "answer": "Similar principles, but simplified. Wim Hof adds specific breathing exercises (hyperventilation). This stack focuses on cold exposure + mindfulness meditation. If you want to add Wim Hof breathing, do it before the cold shower."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see results?",
      "answer": "Mental clarity: Immediate (same session). Stress resilience: 2-3 weeks. Habit automation: 60-75 days. Most users report feeling 'like a different person' by Day 30."
