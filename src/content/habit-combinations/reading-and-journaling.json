    "headline": "The Knowledge Retention Loop: Why Reading Without Journaling Is Forgetting",
    "explanation": "Reading is input. Journaling is processing. Without the second step, you're consuming information but not internalizing it. Research shows journaling after reading improves comprehension by 34% and retention by 50%. This isn't note-taking - it's active recall, the most powerful learning technique known to neuroscience. You're transforming passive reading into active learning.",

    "neuroscience": "Reading activates Wernicke's area (comprehension). Journaling activates Broca's area (production) + motor cortex (writing).

    {
      "question": "Should I handwrite or type my journal?",
      "answer": "Handwriting is better for retention (23% better comprehension), but typing is faster and searchable. Best approach: Handwrite key insights, type detailed notes. Mix both based on your goals - retention vs. searchability."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I journal after reading?",
      "answer": "Start with 3 minutes (3 sentences). Work up to 5-10 minutes. Quality over quantity - one deep insight beats 3 pages of summaries. The goal is active processing, not book reports."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I didn't learn anything new from what I read?",
      "answer": "Journal about WHY nothing stood out. Was the book bad? Were you distracted? This meta-reflection is valuable learning about your reading process. Even 'meh' books teach you what NOT to read next."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to finish books before journaling?",
      "answer": "No. Journal daily after each session. Waiting until you finish the book means you'll forget 80% of what you read. Daily journaling captures insights in real-time, while they're fresh."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I journal about fiction or just non-fiction?",
      "answer": "Both. Fiction journals can explore themes, character insights, emotional reactions. Non-fiction journals focus on actionable takeaways. Different genres, different journal styles - both deepen understanding."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I remember to journal after reading?",
      "answer": "Habit stacking: Keep journal on top of your book. When you close the book, the journal is the next thing you see. Physical proximity = automatic trigger. NooLife also prompts you after logging reading time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I just highlight in the book instead of journaling?",
      "answer": "No. Highlighting is passive (illusion of learning). Journaling is active recall - you must retrieve and rephrase ideas in your own words. That retrieval effort is what creates memory. Highlighting ≠ learning."
