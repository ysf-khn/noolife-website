    "headline": "Why Morning Reading Beats Evening: The Cognitive Fresh State",
    "explanation": "Your brain's working memory capacity is highest in first 2-3 hours after waking. Evening reading fights against decision fatigue + adenosine (sleep pressure). Morning reading = fresh cognitive state, peak absorption. Research shows 31% better retention from morning vs. evening reading. Plus: Early wake gives PURPOSE. You're not just waking early 'because discipline' - you're waking to read.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Should I read fiction or non-fiction in the morning?",
      "answer": "Whatever you'll actually read consistently. Non-fiction for learning, fiction for enjoyment. Morning comprehension is good for both. Many start with fiction (easier, more enjoyable) then add non-fiction. Mix it up."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many pages should I aim for?",
      "answer": "Start with 10 pages (doable even when tired). Work up to 20-30 pages. At 25 pages/day, you'll read 20+ books/year. Quality over quantity - better to read 10 pages with full focus than skim 50."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I fall asleep while reading?",
      "answer": "Don't read in bed or lying down. Sit upright in chair with good lighting. If still sleepy, splash cold water on face first or do 10 jumping jacks. By Week 2, morning grogginess fades naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Physical book vs. Kindle/iPad?",
      "answer": "Physical book is better (no notifications, no blue light, more focused). But Kindle works if you disable notifications. Avoid phone/iPad reading (too many distractions). The medium matters less than consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I read the same book every day or multiple books?",
      "answer": "One book at a time. Finish it, then start next. Juggling multiple books kills momentum. Exception: One fiction + one non-fiction (alternate mornings) works for some people. Test what works for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't comprehend what I'm reading in the morning?",
      "answer": "First week is rough (sleep inertia). By Week 2, comprehension actually IMPROVES vs. evening reading (brain is fresh). If struggling: Easier books initially, coffee helps, annotate as you read (active engagement)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until this becomes a craving?",
      "answer": "21 days to establish ritual. 40 days to feel natural. 66 days to automate. Most users start craving morning reading by Day 30. By Day 66, skipping feels wrong - it's your peace before chaos. Permanent habit."
