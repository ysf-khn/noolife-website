    "headline": "Why Morning Journaling Unlocks Deeper Self-Awareness Than Evening",
    "explanation": "Your prefrontal cortex (self-censorship, social filtering) is weakest in first 30 minutes after waking. Morning journaling captures raw thoughts before daily masks activate. Evening journaling fights fatigue + defensiveness (you justify your day's decisions). Morning = honest self-examination. Research shows morning journalers report 43% more emotional breakthroughs vs. evening. Plus: Early wake needs PURPOSE. Journaling provides that purpose.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I have to write exactly 3 pages like Julia Cameron says?",
      "answer": "Start with 1 page (achievable). Work up to 3 pages by Week 10. The 3-page protocol works because it forces you past surface thoughts into deeper truths. But 1 page daily beats 3 pages never. Progressive stacking prevents burnout."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't know what to write about?",
      "answer": "Write 'I don't know what to write' repeatedly until real thoughts emerge. Morning pages aren't about topics - they're stream-of-consciousness brain dump. Whatever's in your head goes on paper. No editing, no judgment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I re-read my journal entries?",
      "answer": "Not during the 66-day build phase. Re-reading activates self-censorship for future entries. After Day 66, you can review for patterns. But during habit formation, write and move on. No re-reading."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I journal on my phone or laptop?",
      "answer": "Pen and paper works better (no notifications, tactile engagement, no autocorrect censorship). But digital works if you disable ALL notifications and use distraction-free writing app. Phone journaling often fails due to notification temptation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I fall asleep while journaling?",
      "answer": "Don't journal in bed. Sit upright at table/desk with good lighting. If still sleepy, splash cold water on face first or do 10 jumping jacks. By Week 2, morning grogginess fades naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to journal about negative thoughts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely essential. Morning pages are for TRUTH, not toxic positivity. Anger, fear, resentment, jealousy - all belong on paper. Processing negative emotions prevents them from controlling your day. Suppression creates dysfunction."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until journaling feels natural?",
      "answer": "Week 1-2: Feels awkward. Week 3-4: Becoming routine. Week 5-8: Feels essential. Day 66: Skipping feels wrong. Most users report journaling became 'non-negotiable' by Day 45. It's your therapy, cheaper than actual therapy."
