    "explanation": "Conventional wisdom: Quit one vice at a time. Research shows opposite. Smoking and drinking are linked behaviors (80% of smokers drink, 90% smoke more when drinking). Quitting both simultaneously removes cross-triggers. Studies show dual quitters have 60% higher success rates at 1-year mark vs. sequential quitters. You're not fighting two battles - you're removing one interconnected addiction system.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to quit both at the same time?",
      "answer": "For most people, yes. Heavy drinkers should see doctor (alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous). Nicotine withdrawal is uncomfortable but not life-threatening. Medical supervision recommended if drinking 8+ drinks/day or smoking 2+ packs/day."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't quitting both be twice as hard?",
      "answer": "No. They're linked behaviors. Quitting both removes cross-triggers (drinking triggers smoking urge, smoking triggers drinking urge). Sequential quitting = fighting same battle twice. Simultaneous = one hard battle, higher success rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use nicotine patches or medication?",
      "answer": "Nicotine replacement (patches, gum) can help with smoking cessation. For alcohol, medications like naltrexone or acamprosate may help. Consult doctor. Cold turkey works for some, medical support works for others. No shame in using tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I relapse on one - do I give up both?",
      "answer": "No. Restart immediately. Relapse on alcohol ≠ smoking relapse (and vice versa). But be aware: Relapsing on one increases risk for other (cross-trigger). Don't use one relapse as excuse for both. Separate the behaviors in your mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle social situations?",
      "answer": "Avoid bars/parties first 30-60 days (high relapse risk). After Day 60: Bring sober friend, have exit plan, hold non-alcoholic drink, tell host you're not drinking. For smoking: Avoid smoking areas entirely. New social environments help."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I gain weight after quitting both?",
      "answer": "Possible (nicotine suppresses appetite, alcohol has calories). Combat: Replace habits with gym/exercise, track food, allow yourself healthy snacks. Temporary weight gain beats cancer + liver disease. Many users lose weight long-term (better health habits overall)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I feel normal again?",
      "answer": "Physical withdrawal: 1-2 weeks. Psychological cravings: 30-90 days. Full brain healing: 6-12 months. Most users feel 'reborn' by Day 90. Energy, clarity, health improvements obvious by Week 8. Patience required - healing takes time."
