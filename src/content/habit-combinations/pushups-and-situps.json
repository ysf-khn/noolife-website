    "headline": "Why Pushups + Situps Together Creates Complete Core-Upper Body Development",
    "explanation": "Pushups alone = chest/shoulders/triceps development, but weak core stability. Situps alone = ab strength, but no push pattern. Together = complete anterior chain development (front body strength). Military PT tests use this combo for reason: functional strength that transfers to real-world tasks. Research shows combined push + core training improves athletic performance 40% more than either alone.",

    "timing": "Morning (energy highest) or before shower (physical activity cue). 10-15 min total. Can split: morning pushups, evening situps if needed.",
    "order": "Pushups first (require more energy/stability), situps second (core is pre-fatigued, making abs work harder). Alternative: Superset (pushups → situps → rest → repeat).",

    "No rest days (muscles grow during rest - 1 rest day/week recommended by Week 8)",
    "Adding weight too soon (master bodyweight first - 100 perfect reps > 50 weighted reps)",
    "Ignoring pain (soreness okay, sharp pain = stop - ego leads to injury)",
    "Only doing standard variations (plateau after 8 weeks - add variations to keep progressing)"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Should I do pushups and situps every single day?",
      "answer": "Weeks 1-6: Yes, daily (building habit). Weeks 7-10: Consider 1 rest day/week (muscle recovery). Long-term: 5-6 days/week optimal. Daily works for many, but listen to your body. Soreness okay, sharp pain = rest."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many pushups and situps should I start with?",
      "answer": "Whatever you can do with good form. 10 perfect pushups > 30 half-reps. Test max set, then aim for 60-70% of that for daily volume. Example: Max 30 pushups? Start with 20/day total (split into 2 sets of 10)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I can't do a single regular pushup?",
      "answer": "Start with knee pushups or incline pushups (hands on counter/bench). Build strength for 2-4 weeks, then progress to regular pushups. No shame in modifications - everyone starts somewhere. Focus on form and progressive overload."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this actually build muscle or just endurance?",
      "answer": "Reps 1-20: Muscle growth. Reps 20-50: Muscle endurance. 50+: Cardiovascular endurance. You'll build muscle up to ~50 reps, then plateau. For continued growth past 100 reps, add variations (decline, one-arm progressions) or weighted vest."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are situps bad for your back?",
      "answer": "Full situps with poor form = back strain. Better: crunches (partial range), planks, dead bugs. But situps done correctly (slow, controlled, no momentum) are safe. Alternative: Replace situps with plank holds (60-120 sec) for safer core training."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I split the reps throughout the day?",
      "answer": "Yes. Grease the Groove method: 10 pushups/situps every hour for 10 hours = 100 each. This approach reduces injury risk, maintains form, and fits busy schedules. Many find this easier than single 100-rep session."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see visible results?",
      "answer": "Strength gains: Week 2-3 (you'll feel stronger). Visible muscle: Week 5-8 (if body fat low). Six-pack abs: Dependent on body fat, not situps alone. Need <15% body fat for abs to show. Pushups build chest/shoulders visible by Week 6."
