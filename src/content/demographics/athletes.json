    {
      "question": "How does NooLife differ from fitness apps like Hevy or Strong?",
      "answer": "Hevy/Strong = workout tracking only. NooLife = holistic athlete habits (training, recovery, sleep, nutrition, mental game). You're not just tracking reps—you're tracking the full system that creates performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sync NooLife with my current fitness tracker (Apple Watch, Garmin)?",
      "answer": "Not yet, but on roadmap. Currently, NooLife tracks habit completion (did you workout today?), not detailed workout metrics. Use your fitness tracker for reps/sets, use NooLife for consistency accountability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I miss training due to injury?",
      "answer": "Injury = active recovery phase. Track recovery habits (cold shower, sleep, stretching). Streak adjusts to your reality. Elite athletes know: recovery IS training."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to track every single workout?",
      "answer": "Yes. Consistency is the metric that matters. Even light sessions count. 66 days of showing up > sporadic intensity. Your discipline rating reflects this."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does meditation help athletic performance?",
      "answer": "Mental game = 50% of performance. Meditation trains focus, visualization, anxiety management. Olympians use this. You're leaving gains on table without mental training."
