      "question": "What if I work across multiple time zones?",
      "answer": "NooLife tracks YOUR local time. Traveling? Adjust wake time in app. Core habits (meditation, journaling, workout) can happen anywhere. Consistency relative to YOUR schedule, not clock time."

    {
      "question": "Can I use NooLife if I work irregular hours?",
      "answer": "Yes. Define YOUR work hours, build routine around that. Night owl? Track wake time at 11am. Consistency within YOUR schedule matters, not matching 9-5 office workers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does this help with loneliness/isolation?",
      "answer": "Meditation helps process isolation feelings. Workout gets you out of house (gym = social). NooLife community feature connects you with other remote workers. But real solution: coworking spaces + intentional social time."

      "question": "What if I already use productivity apps like Notion/Todoist?",
      "answer": "NooLife isn't task manager—it's habit tracker. Notion = what to do today. NooLife = daily rituals that create productivity. Complement each other. Many users use both."
