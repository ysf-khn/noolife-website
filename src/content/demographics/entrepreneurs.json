      "answer": "No specific time required—but most entrepreneurs wake before 8am for competitive advantage. NooLife adapts to YOUR target wake time. Consistency matters more than clock time. If 6:30am works, track that."

      "question": "How does NooLife create accountability without a boss?",
      "answer": "Streak system + rating visibility. Breaking streak feels bad (intentional design). Your discipline rating shows objective performance. Plus: community feature lets you join accountability pods with other entrepreneurs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my schedule is unpredictable (travel, different time zones)?",
      "answer": "NooLife tracks consistency relative to YOUR schedule. Traveling? Adjust wake time in app. Core habits (meditation, journaling) can happen anywhere. Track what's achievable, not perfection."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm already overwhelmed. Adding habits feels like more stress?",
      "answer": "Opposite. Habits REMOVE decisions (decision fatigue killer). Morning routine = autopilot first 2 hours. Less thinking, more doing. Entrepreneurs who build habits report 40% less daily stress."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize which habits to track?",
      "answer": "Yes. NooLife has 8 core habits + 8 optional (you pick 2). Total = 10 habits tracked. Entrepreneur typically tracks: wake time, meditation, workout, journaling, reading. Customize to your priorities."
