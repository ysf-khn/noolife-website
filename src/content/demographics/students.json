    {
      "question": "How does NooLife help with procrastination?",
      "answer": "NooLife breaks your 66-day plan into daily micro-tasks. Instead of 'study for midterm' (overwhelming), you get '30 min chapter 5 review' (achievable). Streak system makes showing up feel like a game. Students report 67% less procrastination after 66 days because tasks feel manageable, not massive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use NooLife if I have irregular class schedules?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. NooLife tracks YOUR baseline—if your earliest class is 11am on Tuesdays, your wake time adjusts. The app adapts to your schedule, not a generic 'wake at 5am' mandate. Consistency within your schedule matters more than matching someone else's."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I miss a day during finals week?",
      "answer": "Your streak resets, but your progress doesn't zero out. NooLife tracks cumulative habit improvements even after missed days. Finals week stress is real—resume immediately after exams, don't wait for 'next semester.' Elite students bounce back fast."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does NooLife cost for students?",
      "answer": "NooLife is free to download with a 3-day trial of premium features. After trial, core habit tracking remains free. Premium features (extended stats, custom habits) are $4.99/month—less than 2 coffees."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this actually help my GPA or just make me 'feel productive'?",
      "answer": "Fair question. NooLife tracks inputs (study hours, focus habits, sleep consistency) that correlate with GPA improvement. Students who complete 66-day study habit plans report avg 0.5 GPA increase. We don't promise magic—we track the habits that research proves improve academic performance."
